**1. What is Reinforcement Learning (RL)?**
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning where an agent learns to make a sequence of decisions, typically actions, in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. It is inspired by behavioral psychology and the concept of learning through trial and error.

Key components of reinforcement learning include:

Agent: The learner or decision-maker that interacts with the environment. The agent observes the state of the environment, selects actions, and receives rewards based on its actions.

Environment: The external system with which the agent interacts. The environment provides feedback to the agent in the form of rewards and state transitions.

State (S): A representation of the current situation or configuration of the environment. The state is crucial for decision-making, as it helps the agent understand the context in which it operates.

Action (A): The set of possible choices or decisions the agent can make. Actions lead to state transitions and affect the rewards received by the agent.

Policy (Ï€): The strategy or mapping that the agent uses to determine which actions to take in a given state. The policy defines the agent's behavior.

Reward (R): A numerical value provided by the environment that evaluates the desirability of the agent's actions. The agent's objective is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.
